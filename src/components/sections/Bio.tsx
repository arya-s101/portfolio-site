          As an enthusiastic second-year student at the University of Toronto
          (St. George Campus) double majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive
          Science with a minor in Statistics, I am interested in leveraging
          technology to drive meaningful change. I bring robust entry-level
          skills in Java, Python, HTML/CSS, React.js, low-code app development
          and data analysis.
